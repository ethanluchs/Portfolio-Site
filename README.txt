a.	This final product displays a home screen as well as 3 sections relevant to me. The first is a projects section, 
showing my relevant experience. The second is a skills section so users can get an idea of what I can do technically. 
The final section is an about me section so users know who I am and how to contact me.
A user will quickly load into the website and start at the homepage. They will be able to scroll down through 
the one page static site to understand more about me through my experiences and skills. Then at the end, they will 
be able to easily reach out to me as is convenient for them. By being able to present this information in a usable
 and easy way, users can understand more about me quickly. This site uses core web development tech such as HTML, 
 CSS, and JavaScript. There are no special technologies used besides this except for a JS animation library which 
 would be implemented in the future.
